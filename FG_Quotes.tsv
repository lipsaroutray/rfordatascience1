Big dashboard, not good colors.
Dashboard is too big which can consume more power. Color is not good.
Felt weird in both left and right part of the interface (some part analog some are digital).
I do not prefer the touch screen. 
I don’t prefer speech.
Touch screen not in dashboard is fine.
Touching in big screen works in Tesla cars. 
Speech takes time to understand and act. 
"In some places, the language differs so speech may not be a good space
Ready symbol is not recognizable by users"
What is Ready? The dial is useless.
"The visual feedback is bit vague in terms of messages, warning or indicators while doing 
something wrong.  "
"The audio feedback is implemented well but rarely compliments the visual information
shown on the dashboard."
"This dashboard also complements the interface with a few physical buttons attached to 
the steering wheel which reduces the user's effort to touch the screen. "
"There is a dedicated space reserved to show other information which has less priority 
than speedometer and battery indicator along with the other menu options.  "
"Audio feedback has different signatures for various kinds of feedback which is a nice 
touch which complements the visual feedback at the same time.  "
"Icons are important for the car specifically for low battery warning is especially important. 
Icons should be user understandable or should be described in text or voice feedback 
can help. Felt weird in both left and right part of the interface (some part analog some 
are digital)."
"Battery indicator is always visible to the user at all times to indicate the remaining power 
but it misses any battery health related information. "
"Interaction through touch is sometimes more useful than steering control. Too much 
information provided in the display."
"These infaces should be adaptive and require less user interaction. Audio feedback is 
not as rich as other dashboards.  "
The yes/no notification box popping up is not good alert signs or signals are fine.
"Layout looks minimal. Difficult to see/read info while driving. Battery level is too small. 
High contrast text. Text indication in red color not visible/readable."
Much information on the dashboard like charge left in a car must be emphasized.
Extra information is good.
Range and battery are emphasized. Seems okay. 
E tron has extra information which is good.
Required information are present.
Clutterness, bad colors, KW is unknown. 
Information is present but not properly. 
First glance confusing. 
Cluttered information. 
Every info is present not placed properly.
Clutter display, icons are small, difficult color contrast.
Small Icons, cluttered display. 
"Battery info in speedometer is clear, range is not clear in first glance. Essential
information is visible.   "
Felt like range/battery should be given more importance.
Power and range are unidentifiable.
Too cluttered, No needle available, Difficult for color blindness  
"Interaction through touch is sometimes more useful than steering control. Too much 
information provided in the display  "
Symbols are not understandable. Odometer is not legible.
Misuse(big) of battery size
"Customization on the control panel /weather info is not available (It may not be important 
for India-like places but extremely important for other countries where weather change is 
very frequent) "
"Car Infos like tire pressure not present (It’s an important feature. Smart cars should have 
the feature to reduce human effort) "
"The information displayed on the screen should change based on its state. When a car 
is on standby, the user should see relevant information; similarly, when a car is moving, 
the dashboard should adjust to accommodate information related to driving mode.  
Visualization of mode change is required "
Service info provided which is good. 
Showing Carbon use every day can be useful for environmentalists
Battery level isn’t showing in number. Control parameters display looks old school.
"Unnecessary info present. Question pops up are distracting. Alert representation is bad. 
Contrast text in red is not good."
Power is undervalued.
Power meter not understandable.
I prefer clock like meter for both power and speed and battery like meter for charge.
What is Ready? The dial is useless.
"Battery indicator on the left which represents the min and max power is not clear 
because the “Title” “Power” was on the right side so I was expecting to see the power 
information on the right side."
Range and battery are given importance(pros) 
Map is a good feature. 
Map is a good point.
Useful design for minimal map
range is good
Range meter seems unnecessary/only number is required. 
"Distance in range clear. Cannot understand the remaining battery. Looks like it is 
charging."
Don’t know where is range. Personally, I didn’t like the interface.
Maps are good.  Battery representation is bad.
No date and time slot. (4) Battery info missing. No warnings.
Like the speedometer. Info about battery and range could have been better.
Maps are a great advantage. 
Range and Charge are unidentifiable. Maps are a good feature. 
Range is important.  Little boring but well informative. 
Range font is very small. Not emphasized properly. Range display is not visible.
Range awareness is given. 
Information like kw,A,V not required (only battery meter needed)
Battery info is not good.
I prefer clock like battery like meter for charge.
"Battery indicator on the left which represents the min and max power is not clear 
because the “Title” “Power” was on the right side so I was expecting to see the power 
information on the right side."
Bad colors.KW notation for what?
Bad representation of the battery. I didn’t like the user interface.
Maps are good.  Battery representation is bad.
Like the speedometer. Info about battery and range could have been better.
"I miss noticing the power out message (warning) and asking to charge the vehicle. 
I feel lack of information when clock like meter is absent. "
Big size battery is not necessary. It does not look hierarchical.
A big box showing low battery seems unnecessary. It makes me feel stressed.
Just warning “Low battery” is given importance. Charge is not highlighted.
Battery health information absent in the UI which is required.
Icons are important for the car specifically for low battery warning is especially important.
"Representation of battery charge is bit confusing for normal people. Battery level will be
easy to understand if it is written in numeric also."
"Battery indicator is always visible to the user at all times to indicate the remaining power 
but it misses any battery health related information. "
Battery and range are less valued.
"Battery charge level is getting continuous attention which is not necessary. (It is kept in
the center)."
"The arrangement does not look properly arranged. No battery percentage all other are 
ok. "
Battery capacity is absent. Less information (can't understand which is range etc).
"Few things are very small. Battery level is in corner. Too cluttered.  (4)Battery level hard 
to read."
Easy to identify the battery level. Full batter(green) low battery(red).
Design looks boring. Confused what left line indicates. 
Battery percentage could have been big.
Battery level is in very corner. Check color for color blindness. 
Battery level is in corner. Too cluttered.  Battery level hard to read.
Speedometer is analogue. 
analogue speedometer is given.
Dial is useless. Missing clock like speed meter.
I prefer clock like meter for both power and speed and battery like meter for charge.
Does not look like a speedometer. Bad colors.KW notation for what?
Like the speedometer. Info about battery and range could have been better.
I assumed that the information presented on the right was the speed indicator. 
"I personally did not like the interface. I prefer having an analog meter (can be digitally 
displayed also). I feel like I lack information."
Design is boring. I prefer clock like meters that complement this muscle car.
"There is no proper speedometer. Lot of vacant space in the arrangement. Less contrast. 
(No hierarchy in data)"
Digital speedometer looks like analog one which is ok.
"I can clearly see the digital speedometer designed to look like an analogue speedometer 
would help the users to use the interface easily. The interface presented in this 
dashboard has neatly laid out the information based on their priority. "
People prefer to use analogue watch design over digital watch interface.
"Analogue watch interface gives the user a sense of time separation whereas digital 
watch doesn’t. This is the main reason drivers prefer analog speedometer inface over 
digital. "
"Speedometer is quite different from traditional cars, difficult to read, position should be in 
center. So, it will take time to get used to it."
Doesn't look like a speedometer. Bad colors.KW notation for what?
Analogue speedometer is used which is easily understandable.
Overall better-looking design. Digital speedometer is used. 
"Familiar interface. Known Speedometer. Good and familiar interface. Everything clearly 
visible. Everything looks like petrol car."
Analog speedometer absent.
Cannot differentiate which one is the battery power. Analogue speedometer missing.
"Power is not understandable. Too many options.  Speedometer absent. 
Power meter design is very inconvenient. Battery meter design looks more like 
speedometer."
No range shown. Could not understand what is on the right circle. 
"Analogue speedometer absent. Battery level not clear. Colors are too vibrant from the 
background. Distracting to eye. "
"The dashboard is complemented by the physical speedometer, which is a good addition 
for the users who are moving from the gas-based cars."
Graph is unnecessary. 
Unnecessary information (Graphs). 
"In this dashboard, I see Energy flow information is taking center space that I see no 
relevance. "
Mode is given and it is a good feature.
"Mode is given,
I do not understand the driving mode."
Unidentified meter. Modes of driving are given less importance. 
Similar to traditional analogue. Clear mode.
Modes are not visible.
Modes of driving are absent. Less information.
Modes are less important. Colors are vibrant.
Modes are missing.  cluttered
"I think it should have a color contrast against the rest of the UI because it is critical 
information."
Big dashboard, not good colors. 
Dashboard is too big which can consume more power. Color is not good.
"Color of the Icons. Range indicated in the right side of the display which are Not eye 
catching. battery Not properly designed. "
Battery level is hard to read. Contrast issue in text and background.
Power and range are unidentifiable.(3)
"Color blind person. Few things are very small. Low contrast between text and 
background. "
"Cannot see a button to switch off navigation. It can be distracting. Modes are missing.  
cluttered. "
